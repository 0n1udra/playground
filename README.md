# Welcome to my playground / testing area!
This is where I put my little scripts and other sometimes useful files.

## Warning:
Some of these scripts copy, rename, move and even delete files and/or folders, so make sure you read over the scripts and know what they are doing!
I hold no responsibility to what happens to your files/folders if you misuse these.
Most of these scripts you will need to edit the variables containing files/folder paths if you're going to use the scripts.

# Scripts:
- discord_account_switcher.py switch between multiple Discord accounts by moving local files and restarting Discord.
- walli.py makes backups of image files that I make changes to sometimes.
